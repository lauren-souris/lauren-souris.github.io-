      <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Lauren — a TAS teacher-in-training with a love for all things Food Tech, Industrial Arts, and hands-on learning. I’m currently studying at the Australian Catholic University and spend my days designing lessons and learning new skills, that will allow students to create, problem-solve, and explore their ideas. 
      <p>Outside of the classroom, I run a disability support business, working with people of all abilities to help them grow their skills and confidence. Whether it’s in the kitchen, the workshop, or the community, I’m all about creating equal opportunities for people to learn, connect, and achieve things they once thought impossible. </p>
