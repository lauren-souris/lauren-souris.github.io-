          <h3>Food in Nutrition Unit</h3>
          <h4>Brok N' Roll bites</h4>
          <p>I created Brok n Roll Bites in 2024 to fuel Nedd' run, in 2024 with slow-burn carbs, protein, and electrolytes to nourish his body and avoid injury and fatigue. Each ingredient was tailored to meet his specific nutritional needs; providing sustained energy, supporting muscle recovery, and replenishing electrolytes lost during long-distance running.

          <h3>Food Photography</h3>
          <p>This food photography project focused on capturing a cake using carefully selected props and controlled lighting to enhance its visual appeal. Natural and artificial light sources were adjusted to highlight the cake’s texture, colour, and decorative details, while props such as plates, cutlery, and background elements were styled to create a cohesive scene. The combination of lighting direction, shadow control, and complementary props helped convey mood, depth, and a professional finish to the final images.</p>

          <h3>Sustainable Lifestyles</h3>
            <h4> Automatic Plant Feeder</h4>
          <p>Designed and built an automatic plant drip feeder to deliver consistent water supply to plants over time. The system uses a controlled drip mechanism to maintain soil moisture, reduce water waste, and minimise the need for manual watering — ideal for sustaining plant health during busy periods or while away.
