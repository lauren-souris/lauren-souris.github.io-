  <h3>Brock N Roll Bites — Nutrition Unit</h3>

  <img src="Images/brok-bites.jpg" alt="Brok Bites packaging" />

  <p>I created Brock n Roll Bites in 2024 to support Ned Brockmann during his 16,000 km run. Each bite was built for steady energy without a sugar spike: a chewy outer layer made from whole foods; berries, oats, coconut, and dried fruits. This was paired with a gooey, jelly-like centre made from goji berries and other nutrient dense ingredients. The mix delivered slow-release carbohydrates, some protein and healthy fats, plus added electrolytes to help replace minerals lost through sweat. Compact and light, the bites were easy to carry and eat on the move, and contained no added sugars, aligning with the goal of sustained energy over long distances.</p>

          <h3>Safe Work Method Statement Sheet</h3>
          <img src="Images/swms.jpg" alt="Safe Work Method Statement Sheet project" />
          <p>I completed a detailed Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) for a custom hacksaw project. It identified key hazards—sharp edges, hot work, and moving machinery—and set clear risk controls, including guarding, PPE, and safe tool setup. The SWMS outlined step-by-step procedures (measure/mark, cut, drill, assemble) and specified required PPE such as safety glasses, gloves, and enclosed footwear, plus safe use of the hacksaw, vice, and drill press. It also covered pre-start checks and end-of-task cleanup. Overall, it guided safe, consistent practice and supported WHS compliance.

          <h3>Food Photography</h3>
          <img src="Images/food-photography.jpg" alt="Food photography project" />
          <p>This Food Photography project focused on capturing a cake using carefully selected props and controlled lighting to enhance its visual appeal. Natural and artificial light sources were adjusted to highlight the cake’s texture, colour, and decorative details, while props such as plates, cutlery, and background elements were styled to create a cohesive scene. The combination of lighting direction, shadow control, and complementary props helped convey mood, depth, and a professional finish to the final images.</p>

          <h3>Sustainable Lifestyles- Automatic Plant Feeder </h3>
            <img src="Images/plant-feeder.jpg" alt="Automatic Plant Feeder project" />
          <p>For Design & Tech, I designed and built an automatic plant drip feeder to deliver consistent water supply to plants over time. The system uses a controlled drip mechanism to maintain soil moisture, reduce water waste, and minimise the need for manual watering — ideal for sustaining plant health during busy periods or while away. The flow rate is adjustable with a small valve so different plants receive the right amount of water.

    <h3>Chopping Board</h3>
    <p>I crafted a puzzle-piece timber chopping board because I wanted something playful on the bench. I used reclaimed hardwood offcuts, so every board has its own grain and colour—and nothing goes to waste. The soft, rounded edges feel good in the hand, and a food-safe satin finish lets the timber shine. The interlocking shape is a bit quirky and truly unique; pair two together and it doubles as a modular serving set.</p>
